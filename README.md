# Minnehack2023
Inspiration
We were inspired by similar collaborative websites that encourage positive actions in the community. We took inspiration from a plant game called Habitica that encourages you to work on personal habits to grow your virtual plants.

What it does
The user can complete community tasks in a checklist style format, which grows a tree in their virtual garden. The more tasks completed, the larger the size of the tree.

How we built it
We used Django for the back end of the website, used JavaScript and three.js for the 3d rendering of the tree and background. We used html and CSS for more of the front-end of the website.

Challenges we ran into
Trouble with user authentication and rendering 3d models. Also, some of the formatting in html.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We incorporated 3D modeling into our web page to visually display the garden. We set up a user system to link checklist progress with each separate user.

What we learned
We learned basic web development through incorporating users and learned more about 3d rendering on websites.

What's next for Community Garden
In the future we would like to implement collaborative elements to our project so the community can work together to grow a communal garden by doing positive tasks. This would encourage more participation from users.
